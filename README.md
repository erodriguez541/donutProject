Creating a Donut Finder App

This application, titled Go-Nuts, is a specifc food locator app. It allows the user to locate the nearest availble dount. 

The user can enter in their; 
-state 
-city 
-zipcode

The app will use the Google Maps API to create a list of donut shops.


Future developments will include a notification feature so users could be alerted when they are near their favorite donut shops. Also included in future iterations would include a joke feature.
